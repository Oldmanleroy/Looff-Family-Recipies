        <h1>Artichoke Dip</h1>
            <p>This is the Looff family recipe for Artichoke Dip!</p>
            <p>You'll need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Large Jar of Marinated Artichokes</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup of Mayo (Bonus Points if you make it yourself)</li>

        <h2>Intrustions:</h2>
            <p>Pull leaves off of the artichoke hearts, and use the hearts only (I know, morbid). Rinse and dice. Mix
                with the other ingredients and put in a casserole dish. Sprinkle that paprika in, then bake at 375
                for 20 minutes. Serve with your vehicle of choice!</p>
