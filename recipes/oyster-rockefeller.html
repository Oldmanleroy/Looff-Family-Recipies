                <li>Kosher Salt and Pepper to Taste </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Intructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place oysters, whole, on a hot grill (or broiler) until shells begin to bubble, steam, and pop open slightly ~5 minutes</li>
                <li>Taking care for the heat from the shells, shuck and release the oysters from the top of the shell. Reserve as 
                    much of the internal juices as you can. Discard the top shell.</li>
                <li>Top the oysters with a pad of butter and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add minced mixture with parmesan, lemon juice, and panko on top of the oysters.</li>  
                <li>Place the oysters under the broiler until the cheese is melted and breadcrumbs are toasted ~6-8 minutes</li>
                <li>Enjoy the Oysters Looff-style!</li> 
                <li>(If you're feeling extra bougie, place oysters under a bed of rocksalt and then broil!)
